# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL );

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL.

--What is the average danceability by artist and track? 
SELECT artist_name, track_name, avg(popularity), 
ROUND(avg(danceability),2) AS avg_danceability, 
ROUND(avg(energy),2) AS avg_energy
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

--Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity? 
SELECT artist_name, popularity
FROM SpotifyData
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

--What artist released the longest song? 
SELECT artist_name, track_name, max(duration_ms)/1000 AS duration_sec
FROM Spotifydata;

--What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?
SELECT ROUND(avg(danceability),2) AS avg_danceabililty
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE danceability IN (SELECT danceability FROM SpotifyData ORDER BY popularity desc LIMIT 10);

--Which artists had the most top 50 hits in 2021?
SELECT artist_name, count(artist_name)
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY count(artist_name) desc
LIMIT 3;

--How many of the top 50 hits are written in a major key?
SELECT count(song_mode)
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE song_mode = 1;
